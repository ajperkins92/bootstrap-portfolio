            <p>Hi, my name is Alex Perkins and I'm so glad you're dropping by my portfolio!</p>

            <p>A little about me; I grew up in a small college town in Minnesota called Northfield. If you've ever heard
                of Saint Olaf or Carleton colleges, or Malt-o-Meal cereal, then you know something about Northfield!</p>

            <p>I began dabbling in software development/coding about a year ago after trying to create a website to
                write about my various endeavors. That's when I realized I enjoy writing code, particularly the
                combination of the scientific and artistic!</p>

            <p>When I'm not at work as a Technical Account Manager at SkyKick, I can be found hanging out with my wife,
                Waverly, playing with our two bunnies Sage and Juniper, playing a board game (Scythe is a current
                favorite), going on a hike, playing guitar, or drinking a beer in one of Seattle's many excellent
                drinking establishments!</p>
